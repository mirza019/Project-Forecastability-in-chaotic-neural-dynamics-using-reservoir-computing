# Project-Forecastability-in-chaotic-neural-dynamics-using-reservoir-computing

(a) A PDF in which: (1) the first page presents the FULL names, StudonID, matricule number of only the
students that actively participated in the project (being alone in a group, if you prefer, is acceptable, but
I strongly recommend collaboration with some of your classmates, it is a scientific skill that also needs to
be developed). However, not more than 7 students per group is allowed. (2) the rest of the pages show
only the output (plots) of all the required graphs. Please remember to label the figures. Which figure
corresponds to which questions of the project? This should be clear.
(b) The codes that you use to generate each of the output (figures) of the projects. Please also label these
codes accordingly. For example, a Python code used to generate the bifurcation diagram of Problem A
1(a) should be labeled “Prob-A-1a.py”, and so on.
(c) Submission (via StudOn) Deadline: Monday, 1st September 2024, at 6:00 PM
